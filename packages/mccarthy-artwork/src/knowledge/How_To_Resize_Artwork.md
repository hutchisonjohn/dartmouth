## Important Tips

### For Print Quality:
- **Always work at 300 DPI** for professional printing
- **Never upscale low-resolution images** - quality will be poor
- **Save a copy** before resizing (never overwrite original)

### Maintaining Quality:
- Use **"Preserve Details 2.0"** when enlarging in Photoshop
- Avoid enlarging more than 120% of original size
- For vector artwork (Illustrator), resize freely without quality loss

### File Format:
- Save as **PNG** or **TIFF** for high-quality output
- Use **JPEG** only for web/email (lossy compression)
- Keep **PSD** or **AI** files as working copies
