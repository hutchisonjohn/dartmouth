## 📋 MESSAGE TO OTHER DEVELOPER

```
Hey! I'm building PerfectPrint AI in parallel with Customer Service.

⚠️ PLEASE NOTIFY ME BEFORE EDITING:
1. package.json (root)
2. pnpm-workspace.yaml (root)
3. tsconfig.json (root)

I'll do the same for you!

My work: packages/perfectprint-ai/
Your work: packages/customer-service-*/

Thanks! 👍
```

## ✅ SAFE ZONES (No Coordination Needed)

**I'm working in:**
- `packages/perfectprint-ai/` (my folder only)

**They're working in:**
- `packages/customer-service-agent/`
- `packages/customer-service-dashboard/`

**No conflicts expected in these areas!**

## 🔔 WHEN I'LL NEED ROOT FILES

| Step | File | When | What I'll Do |
|------|------|------|--------------|
| **Step 2** | `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | Soon | Add PerfectPrint packages |
| **Step 5** | `package.json` | Later | Add dev/build scripts |
| **Step 6** | `tsconfig.json` | Maybe | Shared TypeScript config |

## 🚨 AI ASSISTANT: READ THIS BEFORE EDITING ROOT FILES

**BEFORE touching package.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, or tsconfig.json:**

1. ⚠️ **STOP AND WARN THE USER**
2. Say: "I need to edit [FILE]. Please coordinate with other developer first."
3. Wait for user confirmation
4. Only proceed after user says OK

**DO NOT EDIT THESE FILES WITHOUT WARNING!**

**This file serves as a reminder for both the user and AI assistant.**
