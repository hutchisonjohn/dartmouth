### 2B. VECTOR EMBEDDINGS RAG SYSTEM 🆕

**Added:** December 5, 2025 (11:45 PM AEST)

**What It Does:** Provides **semantic search** for RAG documents using OpenAI embeddings and Cloudflare Vectorize. This replaces keyword-based search with meaning-based search for accurate information retrieval.

**Why It Matters:** This is a **CRITICAL FEATURE** for a commercial SaaS product. The AI now finds relevant information based on **meaning**, not just keyword matches. For example:
- Query: "How hot should my press be for transfers?"
- Keyword search: Might miss because "hot" doesn't match "temperature"
- Vector search: ✅ Finds DTF application instructions because the **meaning** is similar

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     RAG DOCUMENT UPLOAD                          │
│                                                                  │
│  1. Admin uploads document (e.g., DTF_Guide.md)                 │
│  2. Document is chunked into sections (~300-500 tokens each)    │
│  3. Each chunk → OpenAI Embeddings API → 1536-dim vector        │
│  4. Vector + metadata stored in Cloudflare Vectorize            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              │
                              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     CUSTOMER ASKS QUESTION                       │
│                                                                  │
│  1. "What temperature for DTF?"                                 │
│  2. Question → OpenAI Embeddings API → 1536-dim vector          │
│  3. Vector similarity search in Cloudflare Vectorize            │
│  4. Returns top 5 most similar chunks                           │
│  5. Chunks injected into AI prompt                              │
│  6. AI responds with ACCURATE information                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Technology Stack:**
| Component | Technology | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| **Embedding Model** | OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` | Best quality, 1536 dimensions, $0.02/1M tokens |
| **Vector Database** | Cloudflare Vectorize | Native to Workers, low latency, 5M vectors free |
| **Chunking** | Custom (by markdown heading) | Preserves context, ~300-500 tokens per chunk |
| **Similarity Search** | Cosine similarity | Standard for text embeddings |

**Key Features:**
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Semantic Search** | Finds documents by meaning, not keywords |
| **Automatic Chunking** | Splits documents by ## headings |
| **Batch Embeddings** | Efficient processing of multiple chunks |
| **Relevance Scores** | Shows how confident the match is |
| **Fallback Support** | Falls back to keyword search if Vectorize unavailable |
| **Document Reprocessing** | Admin can reprocess all documents at once |
| **Stats Endpoint** | Shows total chunks, documents, categories |

**Files Created:**
- `packages/worker/src/services/VectorRAGService.ts` - Core vector service
- `packages/worker/migrations/0015_rag_document_chunks.sql` - Chunk metadata table

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/worker/src/services/KnowledgeService.ts` - Uses VectorRAG when available
- `packages/worker/src/controllers/ai-agent.ts` - Reprocess endpoint uses VectorRAG
- `packages/worker/src/controllers/chat-messages.ts` - Passes Vectorize binding
- `packages/worker/wrangler.toml` - Added Vectorize binding
- `packages/worker/src/types/shared.ts` - Added VectorizeIndex type

**Database:**
- **Table:** `rag_document_chunks` - Stores chunk metadata
- **Vectorize Index:** `dartmouth-rag` - Stores 1536-dim vectors

**Current Stats (as of Dec 5, 2025):**
- **Documents Processed:** 9
- **Total Chunks:** 53
- **Total Vectors:** 53
- **Categories:** FAQ, Company Info, Ordering, Privacy, Returns, Shipping, T&C, DTF, UV DTF

**Cost Estimate:**
| Operation | Cost | Volume | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|------|--------|--------------|
| Embed documents (one-time) | $0.02/1M tokens | ~15K tokens | $0.0003 |
| Embed queries | $0.02/1M tokens | 10K queries | $0.20 |
| Vectorize storage | Free | Up to 5M vectors | $0 |
| Vectorize queries | Free | Up to 30M/month | $0 |

**Total: ~$0.20/month** for 10,000 customer queries

**Impact:** AI responses are now **accurate** because they find the right information semantically. No more generic LLM hallucinations - the AI uses **your actual business knowledge**.
