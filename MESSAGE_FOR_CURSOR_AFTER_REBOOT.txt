Hi! I'm continuing work on the Dartmouth OS Customer Service System after a reboot.

PROJECT LOCATION: D:\coding\DARTMOUTH_OS_PROJECT

Please read these files IN ORDER to get up to speed:

1. D:\coding\DARTMOUTH_OS_PROJECT\README_START_HERE.md
   (MUST READ FIRST - complete quick start guide)

2. D:\coding\DARTMOUTH_OS_PROJECT\START_HERE_NEXT_SESSION.md
   (Detailed next steps with code examples)

3. D:\coding\DARTMOUTH_OS_PROJECT\SESSION_SUMMARY_2025-11-29_PART4.md
   (Tonight's progress - 3+ hours of UI work)

4. D:\coding\DARTMOUTH_OS_PROJECT\CS_COMPLETION_TABLE_UPDATED.md
   (Updated completion status)

5. D:\coding\DARTMOUTH_OS_PROJECT\ONBOARDING.md
   (Complete system guide - reference)

CURRENT STATUS:
- Overall Completion: 80% (was 35% this morning!)
- Backend: 90% complete
- Frontend: 85% complete
- Time invested today: 14.5+ hours
- Progress today: +45% in one day!

WHAT'S WORKING:
✅ Email-to-ticket system (100%)
✅ AI processing with sentiment detection (100%)
✅ Dashboard UI with all filters (95%)
✅ Ticket detail view (90%)
✅ Shopify right sidebar (slides in/out)
✅ Staff message display (shows first name only)
✅ Response area toggle (hide/unhide)
✅ Navigation with filter context (My Tickets, VIP, etc.)
✅ Internal notes with Ctrl+I keyboard shortcut
✅ VIP filter working
✅ Assignment display (staff names, not UUIDs)

WHAT'S NEXT (5-8 hours to reach 85% MVP):
1. Connect action buttons (Reassign, Escalate, Snooze, Schedule Reply, Resolve & Close)
2. Implement quick action buttons (@order-status, @tracking, @vip-wallet, etc.)
3. Integrate real Shopify data in sidebar (currently placeholder)
4. Real customer profile & order history data

KEY FILES TO EDIT:
- packages/customer-service-dashboard/src/pages/TicketDetailPage.tsx (main UI)
- packages/worker/src/controllers/tickets.ts (backend API)
- packages/customer-service-dashboard/src/lib/api.ts (API client)
